## Description

In this assignment we were required to use HTML, CSS, and Java in order to create a website that would randomly generate a password for you. With html and Css pages already created for you you needed to incorporate the lessons on functions "if statements" and radomizing a list. After doing so the hope was to create a random password between 8-128 characters that included: uppercase letter, lowercase letter, special characters, and numbers. However not all of those criteria needed to be accepted in order to create the password. This project was the hardest yet as I believe javascript and functions is harder for me to grasp.

## Usage

I found one aspect hard to understand is using links and anchors. and being able to link to a certain spot on your page.

Another aspect was Flexbox and trying to get the hang of putting multiple elements into a container and understanding their relationship to one another
