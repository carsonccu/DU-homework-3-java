## Description

In this assignment we were required to use HTML, CSS, and Java in order to create a website that would randomly generate a password for you. With html and Css pages already created for you you needed to incorporate the lessons on functions "if statements" and radomizing a list. After doing so the hope was to create a random password between 8-128 characters that included: uppercase letter, lowercase letter, special characters, and numbers. However not all of those criteria needed to be accepted in order to create the password. This project was the hardest yet as I believe javascript and functions is harder for me to grasp.
